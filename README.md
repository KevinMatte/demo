## Implementation Notes:

Since this demo_ui is firstly for my own fun, the demo_ui manually builds with implementations that are already supported in
available frameworks. I started with an empty project, and incrementally added technology.


## Development Base

* __Hosts__:
  * __demo_dev 1 and 2__: Development machines for all development activities.
  * __demo_prod__: A 24/7 running latest docker build.
* __Development Notes__:
  * __bin/initDevEnv.sh__: Manually run on every new development install. \
Sets up python's bin/venv Run on __demo_dev__ to provide docker repository access to __demo_prod__(24/7 Host). \
Note: Assumes localhost:5000 isn't already in use.
  * __bin/monitorBuild.sh__: Manually run on every new development session. \
To rebuild to a mounted docker volume for continuous updates.
